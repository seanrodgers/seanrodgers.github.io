    "text": "Any hockey fan knows the story of the Chicago Blackhawks following the 2015 Stanley Cup win. It is one thing to say the team is bad, but is the team that bad or do they have horrendous luck in their 2023-24 and 2024-25 campaigns? Long story short, they are bad. Really bad, but what key metrics make them so bad?\nAnyone that follows the NHL knows the storied franchise has a young roster. With generational talent Connor Bedard joining the franchise before his 18th birthday, it is incredibly obvious that the club is young. Players like Alec Martinez, TJ Brodie, Pat Maroon and Nick Foligno do not raise the bar that much. While the Blackhawks are one of the younger teams in the NHL in the past two seasons, it is not to the extent where it would matter. Take this season for example. Chicago is two steps lower than the Dallas Stars, a team fighting for the President’s Trophy, the best regular season team. This fun anecdote begs the question of what else could be contributing to the lack of success in such a storied organization.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nnhl24 &lt;- read_csv(\"nhl24.csv\")\nnhl25 &lt;- read_csv(\"nhl25.csv\")\n\nbhawks24 &lt;- nhl24 |&gt; \n  filter(Team==\"Chicago Blackhawks\")\nbhawks25 &lt;- nhl25 |&gt; \n  filter(Team==\"Chicago Blackhawks\")\n\nageranks24 &lt;- nhl24 |&gt;\n  summarize(Team, AvAge) |&gt;\n  top_n(32) |&gt;\n  arrange(AvAge)\n\nageranks25 &lt;- nhl25 |&gt;\n  summarize(Team, AvAge) |&gt;\n  top_n(32) |&gt;\n  arrange(AvAge)\n\nage24 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = ageranks24, aes(y=reorder(Team, AvAge),  weight = AvAge), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bhawks24, aes(y=Team, weight = AvAge), fill=\"#CF0A2C\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Average Age of Team\",\n    y = \"Team Name\",\n  )\n\nage25 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = ageranks25, aes(y=reorder(Team, AvAge),  weight = AvAge), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bhawks25, aes(y=Team, weight = AvAge), fill=\"#CF0A2C\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Average Age of Team\",\n    y = \"Team Name\",\n  )\n\nage24 + age25 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Chicago is young, but not the youngest\",\n    subtitle = \"The Blackhawks are not in the bottom five in either season.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Hockey Reference | By Sean Rodgers\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so what else could be the issue? Their special teams units could not be any more bipolar for the 2024-25 season, but it is the complete opposite for last season. Finishing the season with the fifth worst powerplay percentage in the league and one of the worst penalty kill percentages as well. When opportunities to play a skater up arrive for the Original Six team, they do not go out there and take it. This season is almost unbelievable. With the season wrapping up, the Blackhawks have the tenth best powerplay squad in the league. Hard to believe that a team that has secured a top four draft pick for the third season in a row can be so good playing five-on-four hockey. What seems to etch in a theme for Chicago is its penalty kill showed little change from last season to this.\n\n\nCode\nspecialteams24 &lt;- nhl24 |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    PowerPlayPCT = `PP%`,\n    PenaltyKillPCT = `PK%`\n  ) |&gt;\n  top_n(32) \n\nspecialteams25 &lt;- nhl25 |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    PowerPlayPCT = `PP%`,\n    PenaltyKillPCT = `PK%`\n  ) |&gt;\n  top_n(32)\n\nbh24 &lt;- specialteams24 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Chicago Blackhawks\")\nbh25 &lt;- specialteams25 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Chicago Blackhawks\")\n\ndbell24 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = specialteams24,\n    aes(y=reorder(Team, PowerPlayPCT), x=PowerPlayPCT, xend=PenaltyKillPCT),\n    size = 1.7,\n    colour = \"lightgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Green = Powerplay | Red = PenaltyKill\",\n    y=\"Team Name\"\n) + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = bh24,\n    aes(y=reorder(Team, PowerPlayPCT), x=PowerPlayPCT, xend=PenaltyKillPCT),\n    size = 1.7,\n    colour = \"gold\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  )\ndbell25 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = specialteams25,\n    aes(y=reorder(Team, PowerPlayPCT), x=PowerPlayPCT, xend=PenaltyKillPCT),\n    size = 1.7,\n    colour = \"lightgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Green = Powerplay | Red = PenaltyKill\",\n    y=\"Team Name\"\n  ) +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = bh25,\n    aes(y=reorder(Team, PowerPlayPCT), x=PowerPlayPCT, xend=PenaltyKillPCT),\n    size = 1.7,\n    colour = \"gold\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  )\n\ndbell24 + dbell25 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Was Chicago in the top half for special teams?\",\n    subtitle = \"The Blackhawks, shown in green, red and gold, are a significantly better powerplay team this season.

Well, the Blackhawks did exactly this in the recent years. The ideal goal of any hockey team is to register 10 shots on goal per period, making 30 shots a game. With each team playing 82 games a season, the general benchmark for a season shot total should come out to around 2,460 shots. Chicago comes in at 307 shots less than the benchmark last season and a whopping 606 shots less this season’s benchmark. Remembering that the season is not done, this is still terrible. To score, one must shoot the puck. The Blackhawks do not shoot the puck nearly enough.\n\n\nCode\nshooting24 &lt;- nhl24 |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    ShotsFor = S,\n    ShotsAgainst = SA\n  ) |&gt;\n  top_n(32)\n\nshooting25 &lt;- nhl25 |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    ShotsFor = S,\n    ShotsAgainst = SA\n  ) |&gt;\n  top_n(32)\n\nbhshots24 &lt;- shooting24 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Chicago Blackhawks\")\n\nbhshots25 &lt;- shooting25 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Chicago Blackhawks\")\n\nshot24 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = shooting24, \n    aes(y=reorder(Team, ShotsFor), x=ShotsFor, xend=ShotsAgainst),\n    size = 1.7,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = bhshots24, \n    aes(y=reorder(Team, ShotsFor), x=ShotsFor, xend=ShotsAgainst),\n    size = 1.7,\n    colour = \"gold\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Green = Shots For | Red = Shots Against\",\n    y=\"Team Name\"\n  )\n  \nshot25 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = shooting25, \n    aes(y=reorder(Team, ShotsFor), x=ShotsFor, xend=ShotsAgainst),\n    size = 1.7,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = bhshots25, \n    aes(y=reorder(Team, ShotsFor), x=ShotsFor, xend=ShotsAgainst),\n    size = 1.7,\n    colour = \"gold\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Green = Shots For | Red = Shots Against\",\n    y=\"Team Name\"\n  )\n\nshot24 + shot25 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Chicago shot problems\",\n    subtitle = \"The Blackhawks, in green, red and gold, have abysmal shots for totals in both seasons.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Hockey Reference | By Sean Rodgers\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs much as Chicago has awful shots for statistics, their shots against are no different. Keeping in mind the same benchmark, the Blackhawks are either well above it or flirting with being above it. This season has looked slightly better defensively, but its record says otherwise.\nKeeping the same shots theme, the Blackhawks do not score goals. In the 2023-24 season, Chicago had the worst goals per game percentage as well as the worst shot percentage in the entire NHL. In both seasons analyzed, the Blackhawks finished behind the league average in the goals per game category. This season, the Original Six team finished among the top half of the league in shot percentage, but finished in the lower 25% of the league in goals per game this season meaning the team had better shot accuracy this season, but their per game shot totals make this “good” statistic obsolete given that they score less than 2.7 goals in an 82 game season. It is hard to win hockey games not averaging three goals a game.\n\n\nCode\ngf24 &lt;- nhl24 |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    GoalsPerGame = `GF/G`,\n    ShotPCT = `S%`\n  ) |&gt;\n  top_n(32)\n\ngf25 &lt;- nhl25 |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    GoalsPerGame = `GF/G`,\n    ShotPCT = `S%`\n  ) |&gt;\n  top_n(32)\n\nbhgf24 &lt;- gf24 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Chicago Blackhawks\")\n\nbhgf25 &lt;- gf25 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Chicago Blackhawks\")\n\ngoalsfor24 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = gf24, aes(x=ShotPCT, y=GoalsPerGame), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_point(data = bhgf24, aes(x=ShotPCT, y=GoalsPerGame), color=\"#CF0A2C\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 3.081875) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 10.16563) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Shot Percentage\",\n    y=\"Goals Per Game\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=bhgf24, \n    aes(x=ShotPCT, y=GoalsPerGame, label=Team)\n  )\n\ngoalsfor25 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = gf25, aes(x=ShotPCT, y=GoalsPerGame), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  geom_point(data = bhgf25, aes(x=ShotPCT, y=GoalsPerGame), color=\"#CF0A2C\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 2.999062) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 10.62813) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Shot Percentage\",\n    y=\"Goals Per Game\"\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=bhgf25, \n    aes(x=ShotPCT, y=GoalsPerGame, label=Team)\n  ) \n\ngoalsfor24 + goalsfor25 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"If you can't score, you can't win\",\n    subtitle = \"The Blackhawks made significant strides in shot percentage, but still do not score\",\n    caption = \"Source: Hockey Reference | By Sean Rodgers\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is safe to say that the Blackhawks are a bad NHL team. Comparing the storied club to a minor league team would not be a stretch. The main metric that sets Chicago apart from the rest of the league is how little it has shot the puck in the past two seasons. Securing a top four pick in the 2025 NHL draft is good for the development of the club, but what fan wants to see the team do horrendous year in and year out?"
